# ud036_StarterCode
Source code for creating a Movie Trailer website.

Created based on the input from "Programming Foundations with Python"
The code examples and structure is similar to the one taught in the class.

Instead the movies there I added 3 movies which are my favorite ones. 

In order to create the html website, run the entertainment_center.py file which will create a html page with the movies in the file. The html generator fresh_tomatoes.py is provided by Udacity.
